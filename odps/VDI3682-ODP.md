> This repo and project is still under development.

The VDI 3682 proposed concepts and terminology for describing processes within automated systems. According to the standard, a process is a transformation of inputs into outputs, done by a process operator which is assigned to a technical ressource. This technical resource then carries out the processes that are assigned with it. This concept is shown in Fig. 1.
